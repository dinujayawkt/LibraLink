📚 LibraLink – eLibrary Management System

LibraLink is a full-stack library management system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It modernizes the traditional library assistant workflow by digitizing borrowing, returning, and managing books through an online platform.

🎯 Why LibraLink?

Traditional libraries rely on manual assistants to manage borrowing and returning. LibraLink streamlines this into a digital platform with features like:

A QR code-based borrowing and returning workflow (conceptual in this version).

Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

User-friendly experience powered by Tailwind CSS and Boxicons.

⚠️ Important Note: The QR feature is not functional in this version.
LibraLink is currently just the software application. The QR workflow will only work when integrated with the required hardware setup in a real-world environment.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Boxicons
